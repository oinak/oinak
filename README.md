Hello, I am Fernando, a software developer from Madrid, Spain. I started dabbing
in computers around 1986, and writing production software on 1999.
Yes, that's when The Matrix was released &lt;insert joke about how old I am&gt;.

I am specialized in complex e-commerce and fintech web applications specialy
within the Ruby on Rails ecosystem.
I like [leanring new stuff and sharing with others](https://dev.to/oinak/),
I have taught programming courses and collaborated in tech events, such as 
Spainjs, or the [Spanish Rails Conference](http://conferenciaror.es/).

I spend most of my non-working time trying to be a passable father and husband,
but when time allows, I love reading some good sci-fi, cycling, or practicing
martial arts, most recently: Sabre Fencing.
